# Tamarin

Tamarin is an embedded scripting language for Go projects.

Integrating Tamarin into your Go program or library provides extensibility.
You enable users of your application to extend and modify its functionality
without recompiling.

You may also find that the Tamarin CLI is handy for command line scripting,
thanks to the single binary distribution, handy built-in functions, and
convenient syntax.

```go
["welcome", "to", "tamarin", "ðŸ‘‹"] | strings.join(" ")
```

## Use Cases

- Allow users of your Go program to customize event processing.
- Add customization hooks to any CLI written in Go.
- Enable users of your library to write scripts that call methods on your Go structs.
- Add dynamic behaviors to a Go web server to customize initialization or
  request handling.
- Extend game engines with a scripting interface.
- Sandbox execution of user scripts in a SaaS application.
