# Tamarin

Tamarin is an embedded scripting language for Go projects.

By integrating Tamarin into your existing Go program or library, you can add
dynamic scripting and behavior without requiring users to recompile your program.

You may also find that the Tamarin CLI can be handy for miscellaneous command
line scripting tasks, thanks to the simple, single binary Go build and convenient
syntax.

```go
["welcome", "to", "tamarin", "ðŸ‘‹"] | strings.join(" ")
```

## Use Cases

- Allow users of your Go program to customize event processing without recompilation.
- Add customization hooks to any CLI written in Go.
- Enable users of your library to write scripts that interact with Go structs.
- Add dynamic behaviors to a Go web server to customize initialization or
  request handling.
- Extend game engines written in Go with a scripting interface.
- Sandbox execution of user scripts in a SaaS application.
